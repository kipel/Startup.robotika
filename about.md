We feel that the robotics startup community around Tokyo is very disconnected. Inspired by the [Kick it](http://kickit.jp) informal meetings, _Startup Robotika Tokyo_ offers a chance for networking to ***anyone interested in robotic/ML/AI regardless your background***, not only engineers.

Meetings are organized regularly and free to attend although there is a limitiation on the number of attendants, be quick on RSVP your place!

If you want to pitch your idea, practice your pitch or present your startup [let us know in advance]({{ site.url }}/contact/ "Contact Startup Robotika Tokyo"). Both pitch or company presentation must be either in a 10 minutes VC pitch or [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/ "Learn more about Pecha Kucha presentations") format. Expect questions and comments afterwards and ***be open to constructive negative comments***.

What to expect from Startup Robotika Tokyo:

+ Networking opportunities.
+ Honest and constructive feedback to your ideas.
+ Advice or information about startups, VCs, incubators, accelerators, etc.
+ Friendly and relaxed talks about robotic companies and news in the field.


***What Startup Robotika Tokyo is not***:

+ A VC or Angel.
+ A sales opportunity: it is ***fine to present your startup*** to get feedback, but ***don't come to sell your products***.
+ A general startup discussion group: to pitch your Internet startup or app better try [Kick it](http://kickit.jp).
+ A fan club: if you want to talk about your favorite robot this is not the best place for you.
+ A consultant: although participants can give you advice or even been hired, Startup Robotika Tokyo itself is not for hiring.
